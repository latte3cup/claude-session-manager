## What is wmux?

**A native terminal multiplexer for Windows.** Split your terminal into panes, organize work into tabbed workspaces, and let AI agents control everything over a JSON-RPC socket — all from a single desktop app built in Rust.

> [!NOTE]
> wmux is the Windows counterpart to [cmux](https://github.com/anthropics/cmux). Same protocol, native experience.

## Get Started

**Download the installer:**

```
https://github.com/fernandomenuk/wmux/releases/latest/download/wmux.msi
```

**Or build from source:**

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
git clone https://github.com/fernandomenuk/wmux.git
cd wmux/crates/wmux-app
cargo tauri build
```

## Features

**Graphical Split Panes** — vertical and horizontal, infinitely nestable, with high-DPI support

**Tabbed Workspaces** — create, rename, and switch between workspaces from the sidebar

**AI-First Socket API** — JSON-RPC over Windows named pipes at `\\.\pipe\wmux`. Let Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot control your terminals programmatically

**Any Shell** — PowerShell, CMD, WSL, nushell — anything that runs on Windows

**Command Palette** — quick actions with `Ctrl+Shift+P`

**Blazing Fast** — Rust + ConPTY, near-zero overhead, no Electron

## Socket API

The API is what makes wmux different. AI agents connect over a named pipe and control your terminal sessions with JSON-RPC.

```powershell
$pipe = New-Object System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeClientStream(".", "wmux", [System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection]::InOut)
$pipe.Connect(5000)
```

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace.create` | Create a new tabbed workspace |
| `workspace.close` | Close a workspace by ID |
| `surface.split` | Split the current pane |
| `surface.send_text` | Send commands to a terminal |

Compatible with [cmux](https://github.com/anthropics/cmux) v2 protocol.
